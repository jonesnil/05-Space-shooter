This is my space shooter game. Shoot down space ships for 250 points and the UFO which appears every once
in a while for 5000. If an enemy reaches the bottom or you run out of health you lose (you can also die from
colliding with an enemy). Use the arrow keys to move and spacebar to shoot and see how many points you can get.

I used the code from the narwhal vs. penguin as a framework for this project, but added/dropped/modified
a lot to make it work for space shooter purposes.
